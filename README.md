## Projects

### [TP1 - Scene Graph](tp1)

- Everything in specifications done (graph, transformations, textures, lights, cameras, materials, interface)
- Scene with varied elements to show the implementation of the specifications
- We also did turned MyRectangle into a grid of rectangles, so lighting effects (specifically spotlights) would be clearly visible.
- Scene
  - The scene is composed of a tiled area, with a counter with a sink, oven, a table with a bowl/plate with fruits and a plate with a cake and a triangular stool.
